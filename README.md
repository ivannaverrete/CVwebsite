# CVwebsite
Hypermedia project hand-in. Part 1: Create your CV website

# Target user profile
The CV website is focused on giving a general image of the person who CV is about. So the target user profile isn't really centered in one specific.

# Information architecture
The CV is divided in two sections: main information about the person who CV is about on the left, and educational progression throughout life and skills on the right.

# Visual design
Visual design was inspired in my real CV.
